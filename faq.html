<h2>Questions and answers</h2>
<p>Below you will find answers to frequently asked questions about dvd case dimensions, materials, printing, sourcing, and organisation. Each question is presented in an expandable accordion format for easy navigation. Click or tap on any question to reveal the full answer.</p>

<h3>Dimensions and specifications</h3>
<p>Understanding the physical dimensions of DVD cases is fundamental to shelving design, artwork preparation, and shipping logistics. Standard cases follow the Amaray format, while slim and multi-disc variants offer alternatives for space-saving or expanded capacity. Tolerances can vary slightly by manufacturer, so always verify dimensions with your supplier before committing to large orders or custom inserts.</p>

<details>
<summary>What are standard DVD case dimensions?</summary>
<p>Standard DVD cases are typically 7.5 inches tall by 5.35 inches wide by 0.43 inches thick, designed to fit most home media collections and shelving systems. These dimensions correspond to approximately 190.5 mm in height, 135.9 mm in width, and 10.9 mm in thickness. The standard format, often referred to as the Amaray case, accommodates a single disc and provides a spine width sufficient for legible text and small graphics. Slim cases reduce the thickness to about 0.28 inches (7 mm), while multi-disc cases increase thickness to between 0.55 and 0.87 inches (14–22 mm) depending on the number of discs.</p>
</details>

<h3>Printing and artwork</h3>
<p>Custom dvd case printing requires careful attention to file preparation, colour management, and proofing. Artwork must account for bleed, safe areas, and spine alignment to ensure professional results. Digital files should be prepared at 300 DPI or higher, and colour profiles must match the printing process to avoid unexpected shifts in hue or saturation.</p>

<details>
<summary>How do I print custom artwork on DVD cases?</summary>
<p>Most DVD case printing services accept digital files in PDF or image format, allowing you to design custom covers, spines, and back inserts that fit standard case templates. Begin by downloading a template from your case manufacturer or printing service; these templates include precise guides for trim lines, bleed (typically 0.125 inches or 3 mm), and safe areas (at least 0.25 inches or 6 mm inside the trim). Prepare your artwork at a minimum resolution of 300 DPI, using CMYK colour mode for offset printing or RGB for digital proofing. Pay special attention to spine alignment and font size—use at least 8 points for sans-serif typefaces to ensure legibility. Always request a printed proof on the actual substrate before committing to a full production run.</p>
</details>

<h3>Materials and durability</h3>
<p>The choice of dvd case materials affects durability, optical clarity, and environmental impact. Polypropylene and PET are the most common plastics, each offering distinct advantages. Hinge strength, hub retention, and scuff resistance are key performance criteria that should be evaluated through sample testing before placing bulk orders.</p>

<details>
<summary>What materials are DVD cases made from?</summary>
<p>DVD cases are commonly made from polypropylene plastic or polyethylene terephthalate (PET), both offering durability and clarity for displaying disc artwork. Polypropylene (resin code 5) provides excellent hinge flexibility and resilience to repeated opening and closing, making it ideal for cases that will see frequent handling. PET (resin code 1) offers superior optical clarity, which is advantageous when transparent panels are used to showcase interior artwork or disc labels. Both materials are widely recyclable, though acceptance varies by local facility. When evaluating materials, consider surface finish (gloss vs. matte), scuff resistance, and any odour that may be present in lower-grade plastics.</p>
</details>

<h3>Sourcing and bulk ordering</h3>
<p>Dvd case wholesale and dvd case bulk ordering involve navigating minimum order quantities, lead times, sample approvals, and packaging specifications. Supplier evaluation should encompass material certification, production consistency, and returns policies. Clear communication of your requirements—including case style, colour, and any custom features—is essential to ensure that the final product meets your expectations.</p>

<details>
<summary>Where can I buy bulk DVD cases for manufacturing?</summary>
<p>Wholesale suppliers and packaging manufacturers offer bulk DVD cases at discounted rates, ideal for businesses requiring large quantities for distribution. Minimum order quantities (MOQ) typically range from 500 to 5,000 units, depending on the supplier and case style. Lead times vary from two to six weeks for stock items, with custom tooling or colour matching extending timelines to eight weeks or more. When sourcing dvd case wholesale, request samples to evaluate hinge durability, hub retention, and optical clarity. Confirm packaging specifications—cases are usually packed in shrink-wrapped bundles of 10 or 25, then placed in corrugated cartons—and verify that carton dimensions and weight are compatible with your warehouse and freight systems. Discuss material certifications, production consistency, and returns policies to ensure a reliable supply chain.</p>
</details>

<h3>Protection and preservation</h3>
<p>Disc case protection is essential for maintaining the integrity of both the disc and the printed artwork. Quality cases shield discs from dust, scratches, and physical impact, while also providing a stable environment that minimises warping and fading. Environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and UV exposure play a significant role in long-term preservation.</p>

<details>
<summary>Why should I use protective DVD cases?</summary>
<p>Quality DVD cases protect discs from dust, scratches, and physical damage while preserving artwork and extending the lifespan of your media collection. A well-designed case features a secure hub that grips the disc centre hole firmly enough to prevent movement during transit, yet releases the disc smoothly without excessive force. The case shell shields the disc surface from abrasion and impact, while the printed insert is protected from fading and tearing. For archival collections, store cases in a climate-controlled environment with stable temperature (15–21°C or 59–70°F) and relative humidity (30–50%), and avoid direct sunlight to prevent UV degradation of both plastic and printed materials.</p>
</details>

<h3>Organisation and storage</h3>
<p>Effective dvd case storage solutions balance accessibility, space efficiency, and long-term preservation. Organisation methods vary by personal preference and collection size, but common approaches include alphabetical sorting by title, genre-based grouping, and director or actor-based arrangement. Shelving, dividers, and dvd storage box options all contribute to a well-organised library.</p>

<details>
<summary>How do I organize my DVD case collection?</summary>
<p>Arrange cases alphabetically by title, genre, or director on shelving units, using dividers and storage boxes to maximize space and accessibility. Alphabetical sorting by title is intuitive and simplifies retrieval, while genre-based organisation groups similar content together for easier browsing. Director or actor-based sorting appeals to cinephiles who follow specific creators. Use labelled dividers to mark sections and prevent cases from leaning or toppling. Ensure that shelving is sturdy and appropriately spaced—most media shelves feature adjustable shelves 8 to 10 inches apart. For long-term storage, consider dvd storage box options such as lidded bins for archival purposes or drawer-style units for frequently accessed titles. Maintain stable environmental conditions and periodically inspect cases for damage, replacing cracked hinges or broken hubs as needed.</p>
