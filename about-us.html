<h1>About DVD Case and Our DVD Packaging Design Approach</h1>

<section id="mission">
<h2>Mission and audience</h2>
<p>DVD Case is dedicated to providing practical, standards-first guidance on dvd case storage solutions, custom dvd cases, dvd case replacement, dvd case printing, dvd case dimensions, dvd case materials, dvd storage box options, disc case protection, and dvd packaging design. Our mission is to serve an international audience of collectors, small labels, educators, and packaging buyers who require reliable, actionable information to make informed decisions about DVD case selection, sourcing, and organisation.</p>
<p>We recognise that the DVD format remains relevant for archival collections, educational institutions, independent film distribution, and personal libraries. While digital streaming has transformed media consumption, physical media offers tangible ownership, superior audio and video quality for certain releases, and independence from internet connectivity and subscription services. Our content addresses the practical needs of those who continue to value and invest in physical media.</p>
<p>Our audience spans multiple roles and geographies. Collectors seek guidance on dvd case storage solutions and organisation methods to maintain and expand their libraries. Small labels and independent distributors require detailed information on custom dvd cases, dvd case printing workflows, and dvd case wholesale sourcing to bring their titles to market. Educators and librarians need to understand dvd case materials and disc case protection to preserve instructional and archival content. Packaging buyers evaluate dvd case manufacturers and dvd case bulk ordering options to optimise cost, quality, and supply chain reliability. We tailor our content to meet the diverse needs of these audiences, providing both high-level overviews and granular technical details.</p>

<section id="method">
<h2>How we evaluate cases and suppliers</h2>
<p>Our evaluation methodology is grounded in measurable criteria and repeatable testing procedures. When assessing DVD cases, we examine material type, hinge durability, hub retention, optical clarity, scuff resistance, transit packaging, and consistency across production batches. Each criterion is tested using standardised methods that simulate real-world conditions, ensuring that our recommendations reflect actual performance rather than manufacturer claims alone.</p>
<p>Material type is identified through resin identification codes and, where necessary, independent laboratory analysis. We distinguish between polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), noting the trade-offs in hinge flexibility, optical clarity, and recyclability. Hinge durability is tested by opening and closing the case at least 50 times, inspecting for stress-whitening, cracking, or loss of tension. Hub retention is evaluated by inserting and removing a disc 20 or more times, checking for deformation of the disc centre hole and assessing the force required for insertion and removal.</p>
<p>Optical clarity is measured by holding the case up to a uniform light source and inspecting for haze, discolouration, or surface imperfections. Scuff resistance is tested by subjecting the case to controlled abrasion using standardised materials, then evaluating the visibility of scratches under normal lighting conditions. Transit packaging is assessed by simulating drop tests, vibration, and temperature fluctuations to ensure that cases arrive undamaged and that hubs maintain their grip throughout the supply chain.</p>
<p>Consistency across batches is critical for large-scale buyers. We recommend requesting samples from multiple production runs and comparing colour, hinge tension, and hub grip. Variations in these parameters can indicate inconsistent quality control or changes in raw material sourcing. When evaluating dvd case manufacturers, document your requirements in writing—including case style, dimensions, material grade, colour, and any custom features—and request a sample approval process that includes physical prototypes and, if applicable, printed inserts assembled in the case.</p>

<section id="editorial">
<h2>Editorial policy and sourcing</h2>
<p>Our editorial policy prioritises accuracy, transparency, and independence. All claims are supported by reputable references, including industry standards, peer-reviewed research, government publications, and established technical resources. We distinguish clearly between objective measurements (such as dvd case dimensions and material properties), industry conventions (such as standard spine widths and hub designs), and user preferences (such as organisation methods and aesthetic choices).</p>
<p>We do not accept payment or incentives from dvd case manufacturers, suppliers, or printing services in exchange for favourable coverage. Our recommendations are based solely on performance criteria and suitability for the intended use case. When we reference specific suppliers or products, it is to illustrate a point or provide context, not to endorse a particular brand. Readers are encouraged to conduct their own due diligence, request samples, and compare multiple suppliers before making purchasing decisions.</p>
<p>Our content is updated regularly to reflect changes in materials, manufacturing processes, and industry best practices. We monitor developments in polymer science, printing technology, and sustainability initiatives to ensure that our guidance remains current. When new information becomes available—such as revised recycling guidelines or improved hub designs—we update the relevant sections and note the revision date.</p>

<h2>Contact and corrections</h2>
<p>We welcome feedback, corrections, and suggestions for additional content. If you identify an error in our guidance—such as an incorrect measurement, outdated supplier information, or a mischaracterisation of a material property—please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@dvdcase.org">info@dvdcase.org</a>. When submitting a correction, please include the following details to help us investigate and respond promptly:</p>
<ul>
<li>The specific page and section where the error appears.</li>
<li>A clear description of the error and the correct information.</li>
<li>The source of the correct information (e.g., manufacturer specification sheet, industry standard, peer-reviewed publication).</li>
<li>Your contact information if you would like a response or acknowledgement.</li>
</ul>
<p>While we cannot accept photographs or other visual media due to the text-based nature of our site, detailed text descriptions are highly valuable. For example, if you have measured a case and found dimensions that differ from our stated values, please provide the case type, manufacturer (if known), measurement method (e.g., digital callipers), and the specific dimensions you recorded.</p>
<p>We review all submissions and update our content as warranted. Corrections are typically implemented within two weeks of verification. For time-sensitive issues—such as safety concerns or significant regulatory changes—we prioritise updates and may publish interim notices while we complete our review.</p>

<h2>External references</h2>
<p>Our guidance is informed by authoritative external sources that provide independent, peer-reviewed, or government-backed information. We cite these references to support our claims and to offer readers pathways to deeper exploration of specific topics. Below are key external resources relevant to dvd case materials, dvd case printing, and sustainability considerations.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.oecd.org/environment/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Consumer guidance on recycling and materials</a> from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) offers international perspectives on plastics recycling, material lifecycle assessment, and policy frameworks. This resource is particularly valuable for buyers seeking to align their dvd case sourcing with corporate sustainability goals or regulatory requirements in multiple jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prepress" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Printing and prepress overview</a> on Wikipedia provides an accessible introduction to the technical processes involved in preparing artwork for print production. Understanding prepress workflows—including colour separation, proofing, and plate making—helps designers and small labels avoid common pitfalls in dvd case printing and ensures that custom dvd cases meet professional standards.</p>
